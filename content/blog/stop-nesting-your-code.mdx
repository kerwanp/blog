title: Stop Nesting Your Code

I am what we call a **Never Nester** and in this Post I will show you why and how to become one of us.

## What is Nesting?

When using conditions, for-loops or while-loops we add one layer of indentation of the wrapped code. Some languages requires it and some no. But at the end it is **essential** for readability.

In the following code that I purposely made unappealing for this Post, we can see that we have up to three layers:

- The condition matching the email
- The condition checking for an existing user
- The try catch for the creation of our user

```typescript
async function registerUser(email: string, plainPassword: string) {
  if (email.match(/^[\w-\.]+@([\w-]+\.)+[\w-]{2,4}$/)) {
    let user = await findUserByEmail(email);
    if (!user) {
      const rounds = process.env.BCRYPT_ROUNDS;
      if (rounds) {
        try {
          const password = await bcrypt.hash(plainPassword, 10);
          user = await createUser(email, password);
          return user;
        } catch (e) {
          throw new Error("Error while creating user");
        }
      } else {
        throw new Error("Environment variable BCRYPT_ROUNDS not found");
      }
    } else {
      throw new Error("User already exists");
    }
  } else {
    throw new Error("Not a valid email");
  }
}
```

## The problem of Nesting

**The more layers you have, the harder it is to read.**

When reading nested code we have to keep in mind in what context we are, in what conditions or loop we are.

And when using `if {} else {}` we have to go back and forth to understand what happens if the condition does not match while keeping the context when reading.

## How to Denest

### Invert your code

We usually write our code the way we think it:

- "I want to be sure that my email is exact"
- "I want to be sure that I do not have a user with the same email"

But with this process we handle the negative case at the end of our code in the `else`. Instead we should imagine our code this way:

- "I do not want a user with a wrong email"
- "I do not want to have a user with the same email"

The goal of this process is to `return` or `throw` as early as possible:

```typescript
async function registerUser(email: string, plainPassword: string) {
  if (!email.match(/^[\w-\.]+@([\w-]+\.)+[\w-]{2,4}$/)) {
    throw new Error("Not a valid email");
  }

  let user = await findUserByEmail(email);
  if (user) {
    throw new Error("User already exists");
  }

  const rounds = process.env.BCRYPT_ROUNDS;
  if (!rounds) {
    throw new Error("Environment variable BCRYPT_ROUNDS not found");
  }

  try {
    const password = await bcrypt.hash(plainPassword, 10);
    user = await createUser(email, password);
    return user;
  } catch (e) {
    throw new Error("Error while creating user");
  }
}
```

We now have only one layer by simply inverting our conditions.

### Extract your code

By extracting we do not only improve the readability of our code, but also its reusability and abstraction.

To find what we should extract we have to ask ourself what are the minimum dependencies required by the code I'm writing.

The method is to replace most of `the` by `a` and removing most of the subjects we can.

For example:

- "I want to hash the password of the user that I am registering using the environment variable `BCRYPT_ROUNDS` that can be undefined"

Become:

- "I want to hash a password using the environment variable `BCRYPT_ROUNDS` that can be undefined"

> We know for sure that we will always hash the password everytime a user is created, we can also move this part in the `createUser` function to avoid future duplicated code.

```typescript
async function createUser(email, password): Promise<User> {
  return db.users.insert({
    email,
    password: hashPassword(password),
  });
}

async function hashPassword(password: string) {
  const rounds = process.env.BCRYPT_ROUNDS;
  if (!rounds) throw new Error("Environment variable BCRYPT_ROUNDS not found");
  return bcrypt.hash(password, 10);
}

async function registerUser(email: string, plainPassword: string) {
  if (!email.match(/^[\w-\.]+@([\w-]+\.)+[\w-]{2,4}$/)) {
    throw new Error("Not a valid email");
  }

  let user = await findUserByEmail(email);
  if (user) {
    throw new Error("User already exists");
  }

  return createUser(email, plainPassword);
}
```
