## Goals & Challenges

The primary goal was to transform Dotfile’s cloud infrastructure to better support its growth while significantly boosting security and compliance. Key challenges included:

- **Zero trust Security**:  
  Establish a robust, zero-trust security model that rigorously verifies every access attempt, ensuring the utmost protection for sensitive data.

- **Scalability and Flexibility:**  
  Build an infrastructure that can follow the company’s rapid growth trajectory and facilitating Dotfile to meet their SLA commitments.

- **Regulatory Compliance**:  
  Attain and maintain industry-leading standards, specifically targeting SOC 2 and ISO 27001, to foster trust among clients and stakeholders.

- **Operational Efficiency:**  
  Implement modern cloud tooling to streamline deployment and maintenance, facilitating agile responses to emerging needs.

## Approach & Technologies

- **Workloads segregation:**  
  Reduce blast radius and enhance security by isolating workloads into separate AWS accounts, with strict and clear security policies and access controls.

- **Zero-trust architecture:**  
  Reduce attack surface by implementing a zero-trust architecture with zero public endpoint and strict security policies following industry standards.

- **Forensic Ready:**  
  Create a forensic-ready infrastructure by implementing comprehensive logging and monitoring solutions, ensuring that all access and actions are recorded and can be audited.

- **Modern Cloud Automation Tools:**  
  Entirely manage the infrastructure using [Terraform](https://terraform.io), [Terragrunt](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/) and [CDKTF](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cdktf), enabling infrastructure as code and facilitating rapid deployment and scaling.

## Conclusion

Dotfile’s journey to a compliant cloud showcases the power of modern cloud engineering.

By migrating to a multi-account structure with a zero‑trust architecture and strict workload isolation, Dotfile fortified its security and achieved forensic readiness.

Leveraging Terraform, Terragrunt, and CDKTF for infrastructure as code enabled rapid, scalable deployments while meeting SOC 2 and ISO 27001 requirements.

This transformation not only protects sensitive data but also empowers Dotfile to support rapid growth and drive future innovation.
