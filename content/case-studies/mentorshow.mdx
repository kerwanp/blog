## Overview

MentorShow is a dynamic online masterclass platform offering exclusive courses from renowned experts.

The legacy platform delivered inconsistent user experiences and hampered the rollout of new features, making it difficult to support rapid expansion. With plans to enter new international markets, the platform needed a complete rebuild to ensure a unified, high-performance experience across all devices.
